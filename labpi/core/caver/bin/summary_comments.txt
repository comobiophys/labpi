            ID: Identification of a given tunnel cluster = ranking of a given cluster 
                based on the Priority.
            No: Total number of tunnels belonging to a given cluster.
      No_snaps: Nubmer of snapshots with at least one tunnel 
                with a radius >= probe_radius (see config.txt).
        Avg_BR: Average bottleneck radius [A].
        Max_BR: Maximimum bottleneck radius [A].
         Avg_L: Average tunnel length [A].
         Avg_C: Average tunnel curvature.
      Priority: Tunnel priority calculated by averaging tunnel
                throughputs over all snapshots (zero value used for 
                snapshots without tunnel).
Avg_throughput: Average tunnel throughput.
   Avg_up_E_BR: Average upper error bound of bottleneck radius estimation.
   Avg_up_E_TR: Average upper error bound of tunnel profile radii estimation.
   Max_up_E_BR: Maximal upper errors bound of bottleneck radii estimation.
   Max_up_E_TR: Maximal upper error bound of tunnel radii estimation.
            SD: Standard deviation [A].
All averaged values are calculated over snapshots, where a given cluster has at least one tunnel. The only exception is the Priority, where the average is calculated over all snapshots.
If there are more tunnels in one snapshot, the cheapest tunnel is chosen.
